## Benchmarks

All times given in seconds

### Problem Five
* Ruby: 4.605 from command line
* C: 0.211 from command line
* Javascript: 0.345 from command line
* SuperCollider: 35.182 from command line, 34.189 not including
  interpreter start/stop

### Problem Four
* Ruby: 0.361 from command line
* C: 0.049 from command line
* Javascript: 0.345 from command line
* SuperCollider: 2.193 from command line, 1.32 not including
  interpreter start/stop

### Problem Four
* Ruby: 0.361 from command line
* C: 0.049 from command line
* Javascript: 0.345 from command line
* SuperCollider: 2.193 from command line, 1.32 not including
  interpreter start/stop

### Problem Three
* Ruby: 0.030 from command line
* C: 0.001 from command line
* Javascript: 0.066 from command line
* SuperCollider: 0.90 from command line, 0.0002 not including
  interpreter start/stop

Note: SuperCollider can't represent integers over 32 bits, had to use
a float.
