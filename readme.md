## Benchmarks

All times given in seconds

### Problem Three
* Ruby: 0.030 from command line
* C: 0.001 from command line
* SuperCollider: 0.90 from command line, 0.0002 not including
  interpreter start/stop

Note: SuperCollider can't represent integers over 32 bits, had to use
a float.

### Problem Two
* Ruby: 0.037 from command line
* C: 0.001 from command line
* SuperCollider: 0.89 from command line, 0.0003 not including
  interpreter start/stop

### Problem One
* Ruby: 0.049 from command line
* C: 0.001 from command line
* Javascript: 0.056 from command line
* SuperCollider: 1.01 from command line, 0.0004 not including
